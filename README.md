# 🐹 Juliana Learns Go

Welcome to my Go (Golang) learning journey! 🚀  
This repository documents my progress from basic concepts to real-world projects.

Here you will find:
- 📚 Examples and exercises
- 🧪 Experiments and notes
- 🛠️ Small projects applying best practices

The goal is not only to learn Go, but also to build practical solutions and grow as a software engineer.
